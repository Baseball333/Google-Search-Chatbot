# Google-Search-Chatbot
This repository describes the development of a chatbot powered with omniscience and a vast amount of inputs based on the Google search engine.

First Commit:
This chatbot is based around a Python API and web interface. A chatbot is a machine learning application which can theoretically accept an infinite number of language inputs. To create such a system would require a level of effectively impossible complexity for one programmer. Luckily a superficially infinite system already exists which is fully accessible. The chatbot's input base will be the Google search engine. For this problem the basic algorithm is to perform a Google search of a user's input, scrape the text from the first result and reply to the user with the first sentence of that page's result.

Second Commit:
The chatbot must be programmed with theoretical omniscience. "Omniscience" is a characteristic of machine learning applications which pertain infinite knowledge(based on inputs). A Python Google Search library is installed on the local directory to initiate the project. The first file is google_search.py.
